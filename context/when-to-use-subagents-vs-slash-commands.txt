When to use agents vs /commands in Claude:

**Agents excel at specialized roles:**
• Code reviewer with Rust principles
• UI critic with Apple's HIG guidelines
• Security auditor for OWASP compliance
• Test writer who thinks edge cases
• Documentation expert who writes like Stripe

**Commands orchestrate the symphony:**
• Chain agents: plan → build → review → deploy
• Run parallel: 5 agents fix 5 different bugs simultaneously  
• Mix perspectives: TypeScript agent reviews Ruby code
• Create workflows: "/fix-all" spawns specialized fixers

Agents can't call agents. This forces clean architecture.

Think of agents as world-class specialists. Commands are the directors who know exactly when to bring each expert on stage.
